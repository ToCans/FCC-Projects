        <h4>Toby</h4>
        <p>
            Toby is a brown square tram engine who works on Thomas' Branch Line with his coach Henrietta. Toby is wise
            and always willing to share his experience and knowledge with the other engines. He is careful with every
            job he undertakes, causing him to rarely have any accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's noted that Toby's favorite song is: Taste
        </p>

    <div id="percy">
        <h4>Percy</h4>
        <p>
            Percy is a little green saddle tank engine who was brought to Sodor to help run the railway during Gordon,
            Henry and James' strike. He is Thomas' best friend and is quite cheeky, often getting himself into trouble
            with his attempts to play tricks on the other engines. Percy's favourite job is to deliver the mail and he
            works on Thomas' Branch Line as a goods engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's noted that Percy's favorite song is: Bad and Bougie
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="gordon">
        <h4>Gordon</h4>
        <p>
            Gordon is a big blue tender engine who works on the Main Line. He is Flying Scotsman's only surviving
            brother. Gordon is also one of the fastest and strongest engines on the Island of Sodor, whose main task is
            to pull the Wild Nor' Wester, the railway's express train. At times, this leads him to feel superior and
            cause him to become boastful.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's noted that Gordon's favorite song is: Plain Jane
